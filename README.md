# 21s

### work-in-progress.

A game of '21' in JavaScript, using TDD and the Jasmine testing framework.

To shuffle the deck I implemented the the [Fisher-Yates shuffle](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/).


###Usage

Clone this repo.
At present there is no GUI so run the code via Node REPL or the Chrome console.
More usage instructions coming soon.

###Tests

Install NodeJS and NPM.

Install the Jasmine module from npm:

``` npm install -g jasmine ```

Tests are written using Jasmine 2.4. 
Once the above dependencies are installed, you can run the tests using the ``` jasmine ``` command from the root directory via the command line.
